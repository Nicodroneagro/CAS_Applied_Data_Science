It can be a camera, a temperature sensor, a telescope, a microscope (with a camera), a microphone, a particle detector etc. Normally the data is then digitised, maybe preprocessed and written to some media in a certain format, e.g. as a comma separated value (csv) file to a hard disk. This part of the data management is normally taken care of by engineers.\n",

Time series of financial data, customers, passengers, facebook likes, twitter tweets etc. This is data which is normally already on a media with some interface for access, e.g. paper to be read by a camera, a file on youtube, a table on wikipedia etc. We will look at some ways to collect such data. Some programming and computer skills are needed to do so. It may be that this part of the data management is taken care of by specialised computer scientists, but it may also be expected from a data scientist to have these skills.\n",
